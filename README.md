# Tic-Tac-Toe in C <br/>
This is a classic game of tic-tac-toe implemented in C using enums,two-dimensional arrays, and functions. <br/>
The game board is represented as a 3x3 two-dimensional array of characters, <br/>
where 'X' represents the first player, 'O' represents the second player, and ' ' (a space character) represents an empty cell on the board. <br/>
The game logic is implemented using enums to represent the game state, including the current player's turn, game outcome, and game status (ongoing or over). <br/>

The program includes functions to initialize the game board, <br/>
print the current state of the board, check for a winning condition, and handle player moves. <br/>
The game continues until one player wins, or the board is full (a draw). <br/>
The program also includes error handling for invalid user input and the ability to restart the game. <br/>

This implementation of tic-tac-toe in C is a great example of how to use enums,<br/>
two-dimensional arrays, and functions to implement a simple game with a clear separation of concerns. <br/>
Feel free to download, modify, and use the code for your own projects or as a learning tool. <br/>
